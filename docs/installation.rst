TODO THIS NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN

Stable release
--------------

To install inferno, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install inferno

This is the preferred method to install inferno, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
